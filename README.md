Introduction
Electrooculography (EOG) is a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye. The signals are collected from CSV files, combined, and visualized to show the summed signal values of specific channels.


Features
Load EOG signals from CSV files.
Skip metadata rows and extract specific columns.
Combine the signals by summing the values.
Visualize the combined EOG signals for two channels.

Installation
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eog-signal-visualization.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd eog-signal-visualization
Install the required Python packages:
sh
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib


Usage
Place your CSV files in the project directory.
Update the file_paths list in the main() function with your actual file paths.
Run the script:
sh
Copy code
python script_name.py


Results
The combined EOG signals will be visualized in a plot showing the summed values of Channel 1 to channel 50. Below is a sample plot generated by the script:
